URL PATH
-   In main.jsx, wrap the <App /> with BrowserRouter. This allows Routes and Route react elements to work.
-   In App.jsx, Create a Routes react element and next a Route for Auth, Admin, and user.
-   Each of the Route react elements should have a path(a string that contains a url) and an element(the file that you want to connect the url to)
- Create client/src/components create an auth, admin, user. These directories will hold the header, layout and sidebar among other components.
    These components are going to be used and reused in the files in the pages directory.
- Create client/src/pages create auth, admin, user directories. These directories will hold the main content.

CHECK AUTHENTICATION
-   Create client/src/common/check_auth.jsx. In the file, we create if statements that check for various states.
-   If user is not authenticated, they must be navigated to login.jsx. When authenticated, if user is an admin they must be sent to dashboard else they are sent to shop home.
-   We then wrap each layout with the check_auth function in App.jsx
