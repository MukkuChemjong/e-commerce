-   Create server/models/User.js. Inside create a mongoose shcema that contains an object with keys. These are the key-values that are sent to MoongoDB.
-   Create server/controller/auth/auth-controller.js. Inside create a registerUser promise function that will process values from the frontend.
        registerUser extracts values from the request body and checks if email already exists in the DB. Next it hashes the password and creates a new Schema of the new user and saves it.
-   Create another promise function called loginUser in auth-controller.js which checks if email and password match with one in database.
        If email and passwords match, create a jsonwebtoken with _id, email, password, role.
-   Create server/routes/auth/auth-routes.js. Create a post request for loginUser and registerUser.
-   In server.js, connect an api url path to the routes file.
-   In client/store/auth-slice/index.js, create thunks promises for both login and register. Then add extraReducers to the createSlice function which will take care of hte states of both of them.
